A linear regression model with an input collection {yi, xi ,..., xip}i=1n of n statistical units implies that the correlation between the explanatory variable y and the p-vector of regression analysis x is constant. This link is represented by error terms or error variable Îµ, which is an uncontrolled probability distribution that introduces "noise" to the linear connection among the regressors and dependent variable. 

Here in this project model, I applied LinearReg on Weight Prediction model by using dataset of weight , height and age.
